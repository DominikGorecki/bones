			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Bones is a bare-bones responsive grid similar to bootstrap and very similar (and loosely based on) skeleton.  It is written in LESS and gives the developer 100% fine grained control over everything. If your're a type-A control freak, you'll love Bones. What are the  benefits of Bones other than sharing names with an awesome show?</p>
		</div>

      <h2>Benefits</h2>
			<h3>Responsive</h3>
      <ul>
				<li>Responsive down to mobile</li>
        <li>Responsive up to 1280px or more versus the old 960px standard</li>
        <li>More levels of responsiveness than Skeleton and bootstrap gives you a finer grain of control.</li>
			</ul>
      <h3>Minimal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Other RWD frameworks are packed with styling for various elements such as forms and buttons. Bones leaves that up to you.</li>
        <li>Bones is a responsive-grid and only a responsive-grid with nothing else. Even the reset CSS is optional.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Less for More</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Although a compiled CSS file is included (minified and non), Bones is written in LESS with variables you can change and tweak.</li>
        <li>Gives you more control as to what you want to include with your RWD.</li>
        <li>You can make changes and easily compile them into one minified file or let the server do it for you.</li>
      </ul>
		</div>
		<div class="one-third column">
			<h3>Dev Documentation</h3>
      <p>Implementing bones is fairly straightforward, but because it is written in LESS it requires some additional tools in order compile the LESS file into a CSS. Find more information on LESS on their website. If you are developing in windows, I would like to suggest WinLESS to pre-compile you LESS files into CSS prior publish. I do not recommend compiling the LESS file on the client via the JavaScript plugin.</p>
      <p>You can find the full documentation on my <a href="http://www.dominikgorecki.com/download/bones">webpage</a> as well as links to download the framework.</p>
